# Destiny 2 Roguelike - Console Game

A turn-based roguelike game inspired by Destiny 2, featuring three playable classes, multiple enemy factions, and 15 rounds of increasingly difficult combat.

## Game Overview

This is a console-based roguelike where you play as a Guardian fighting through waves of enemies from the Destiny universe. Each playthrough features a randomly selected enemy faction (Hive, Fallen, or Vex), and you must survive 15 rounds of combat, including three boss encounters.

## Game Features

### Character Classes
Choose from three Guardian classes, each with unique stats and abilities:

1. **Titan** - High HP tank with melee focus
   - 300 HP
   - 18-28 base damage
   - Abilities: Fists of Havoc, Flamming Hammer Strike, Void Shield Throw, Void Overshield

2. **Warlock** - Balanced support/damage hybrid
   - 220 HP
   - 20-30 base damage
   - Abilities: Nova Bomb (AoE), Healing Rift, Chaos Reach

3. **Hunter** - Glass cannon with high damage
   - 180 HP
   - 24-38 base damage
   - Abilities: Throwing Knife, Staff Slide, Smoke Grenade, Void Dodge

### Enemy Factions
At the start of each playthrough, you'll face one of three factions:

- **Hive** - "Hive bring a sword" - Aggressive melee-focused enemies
- **Fallen** - "Fallen on the horizon" - Mixed ranged and melee combatants
- **Vex** - "Vex on the field" - High-tech robotic enemies

Each faction has 6 enemy types plus a unique boss that appears on rounds 5, 10, and 15.

### Combat System

#### Your Turn
- **Basic Attack**: Deal weapon damage to a single target
- **Use Ability**: Activate one of your class abilities (each has a cooldown)

#### Enemy Mechanics
- Enemies have varied attacks, some requiring charge-up time
- Some enemies (Cursed Thrall) can self-destruct for massive damage
- Enemy health and damage scale as rounds progress

#### Overshield System
- Some abilities grant overshield (absorbs damage before HP is affected)
- Helps you survive burst damage from powerful enemies

### Game Structure

**15 Rounds Total:**
- Rounds 1-4: 1-2 enemies
- Round 5: First boss fight
- Rounds 6-9: 2-3 enemies
- Round 10: Second boss fight (stronger)
- Rounds 11-14: 3 enemies
- Round 15: Final boss fight (strongest)

**Between Rounds:**
- Automatic heal of 5 HP
- 30% chance for optional elite enemy encounter
  - Choose to fight for weapon boost (+4 damage) or rest for 50 HP recovery
- Boss victories grant +8 weapon damage and full heal

### Progression
- Weapon boosts permanently increase your damage output
- Abilities have cooldowns that reset each turn
- Enemy difficulty scales throughout the run

## Gameplay Tips

1. **Manage cooldowns**: Don't waste abilities on weak enemies
2. **Watch for charging attacks**: Enemies charging powerful attacks can be priority targets
3. **Balance risk/reward**: Elite encounters are risky but offer valuable upgrades
4. **Class strategy**:
   - Titans: Use overshield abilities to tank damage
   - Warlocks: Time Healing Rift carefully and use Nova Bomb on multiple enemies
   - Hunters: High damage but fragile - use dodge abilities defensively

## Victory Condition

Survive all 15 rounds, including defeating all three faction bosses. The game displays your final stats and offers to play again.

## Game Over

If your HP reaches 0 at any point, the game ends. You'll be prompted to play again with a fresh character and randomly selected faction.
